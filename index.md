# Ramazan Kaan Cetin's First CS193 Homework
It was hard to navigate through GitHub but finally managed it!
Now, favourite things
- I love the fact that CS193 is instructed by students!!
- Also, CS193 can be called "weird" in my opinion which is another plus.
- Atmosphere of the lecture is also relieving.
